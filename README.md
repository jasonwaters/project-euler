This repository contains my solutions to several Project Euler problems which I found interesting.  Code and tests for each problem can be found in the `src` folder.  Each problem includes tests and a readme.

## Selected Problems

* [Path Sum](src/path-sum/README.md)
* [Roman Numerals](src/roman-numerals/README.md)
* [Prize Strings](src/prize-strings/README.md)
* [Fibonacci Even](src/fibonacci-even/README.md)
