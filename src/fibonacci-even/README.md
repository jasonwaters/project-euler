# Even Fibonacci numbers
https://projecteuler.net/problem=2

For good measure, and because this is kinda fun, I decided to do one more problem.  I knew this one would be easy from the start, but who doesn't love the fibonacci sequence?

First I wrote a function to determine the nth value in the fibonacci sequence.  This function utilizes an  immediately-invoked function expression so that previously determined values are memoized.

Next I wrote a function that iterates up to a max value and summarizes all even numbers in the sequence up to that value.

I spent about 30 mins on this one.
